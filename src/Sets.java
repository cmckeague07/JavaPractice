         *Key Characteristics of Sets
         * No Duplicate Elements: Sets automatically handle duplicates, meaning if you try to add an element that already exists, it wonâ€™t be added again.
         * Unordered Collection (in most implementations): The order in which elements are stored may not be the order in which they were added (with the exception of LinkedHashSet).
         * Efficient Containment Checks: Sets provide efficient methods for checking if a particular element is present in the collection.
         *
